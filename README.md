# PlantDoc_boost
 The PlantDoc dataset, developed by researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology, represents a significant advance in applying computer vision to agricultural challenges, particularly plant-disease detection. The dataset contains 2,598 samples covering 13 plant species and up to 17 disease classes. However, we found that the dataset still suffers from missing labels, annotation inconsistencies, unrealistic scene compositions, and noisy or distracting samples.
 Based on the issues described above, we performed a systematic cleaning of the original PlantDoc dataset and ultimately constructed the PlantDoc_boost dataset.PlantDoc_boost dataset contains 2,585 high-quality annotated images, covering 13 common crops and 17 disease classes. The crops include: corn, apple, potato, tomato, grape, cherry, peach, strawberry, blueberry, raspberry, pumpkin, soybean, and bell pepper.
